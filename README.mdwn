# txp2ikiwiki

I want to [move my website to
ikiwiki](http://www.schmonz.com/2013/05/27/remembering-textpattern).
This will be an automated conversion tool. I will be:

- **Minimally viably happy** if it handles the conversion of my own site
- **Additionally happy** if it can handle others' sites
- **Further happy still** if it can be included with ikiwiki
- **Further happy still** if it can easily be adapted to import
  other kinds of sites besides Textpattern

## A spec for my site

If my site were just a bunch of pages, I'd know what it does, and
I'd be able to tell whether the converted site did the same things.
It's not, so I don't, and I can't. Plus, some of what it does is
RSS and podcasts.  I'd like to not flood aggregators. So I'm going
to start by writing automated tests that tell me what my site
currently does.
